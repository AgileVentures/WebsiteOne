Feature: Display Statistics
  As a project maintainer
  In order to attract more users to AgileVentures
  I would like to present some attractive statistics to new visitors of WSO

  Background:
    Given the following articles exist:
      | Title     | Content |
      | Article 1 | -       |
      | Article 2 | -       |
      | Article 2 | -       |

    And the following projects exist:
      | title     | description | status   |
      | Project 1 | -           | active   |
      | Project 2 | -           | active   |
      | Project 4 | -           | active   |
      | Project 5 | -           | active   |
      | Project 6 | -           | inactive |
      | Project 6 | -           | inactive |

    And the following users exist
      | first_name | last_name | email                  |
      | Alice      | Jones     | alice@btinternet.co.uk |
      | Bob        | Butcher   | bobb112@hotmail.com    |

    And the following documents exist:
      | title      | project   |

  Scenario:
    Given I am on the "home" page
    Then I should see link "Dashboard"
    When I click "Dashboard"
    Then I should be on the "Dashboard" page
    And I click the "Site statistics" link
    Then I should see a "statistics" tab set to active
    And I should see "Statistics"
    And stats for "Projects" should be "4"
    And stats for "Articles" should be "3"
    And stats for "Members" should be "3"
    And stats for "Documents" should be "2"
