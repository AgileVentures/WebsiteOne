Feature: Private Events
  As a Premium User of sufficient grade
  In order to be able to join a private mobbing event
  I would like to access the hangout link

  Background:
    Given following events exist:
      | name | description        | for                 | category        | start_datetime          | duration | repeats | time_zone |
      | Mob  | Weekly Mob meeting | Premium Mob Members | PairProgramming | 2014/02/03 09:00:00 UTC | 150      | never   | UTC       |
    Given the following plans exist
      | name         | id          | amount | free_trial_length_days |
      | Associate    | associate   | 500    | 0                      |

  Scenario Outline: Premium Mob Members and above see link to join Mobs, watch videos, other users see link to upgrade
    Given the date is "2014/02/03 10:26:00 UTC"
    Given I am logged in as a user with "<plan>"
    Given the Hangout for event "Mob" has been started with details:
      | EventInstance link | http://hangout.test | yt_video_id |
      | Started at         | 10:25:00 UTC        | QWERT55     |
    And the time now is "10:26:00 UTC"
    When I am on the show page for event "Mob"
    Then I should see a link to join or upgrade based on my <plan>
    And I <assertion> see a link to watch the event's past video
    Examples:
      | plan         | assertion  |
      | Premium Plus | should     |
      | Premium F2F  | should     |
