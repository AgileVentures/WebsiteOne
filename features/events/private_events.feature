Feature: Private Events
    As a Premium User of sufficient grade
    In order to be able to join a private mobbing event
    I would like to access the hangout link

    Background:
        Given following events exist:
            | name | description        | for                 | category | start_datetime          | duration | repeats | time_zone | project | repeats_weekly_each_days_of_the_week_mask | repeats_every_n_weeks |
            | Mob  | Weekly Mob meeting | Premium Mob Members | Mob      | 2014/02/03 09:00:00 UTC | 150      | never   | UTC       |         |                                           |                       |
        Given the following plans exist
            | name         | id          | amount | free_trial_length_days |
            | Associate    | associate   | 500    | 0                      |
            | Premium      | premium     | 1000   | 7                      |
            | PremiumMob  | premiummob  | 2500   | 0                      |
            | PremiumF2F  | premiumf2f  | 5000   | 0                      |
            | Premium Plus | premiumplus | 10000  | 0                      |

    Scenario Outline: show mob hangout links to users with correct plans
        Given the date is "2014/02/03 10:26:00 UTC"
        Given I am logged in as a user with "<plan>"
        Given the Hangout for event "Mob" has been started with details:
            | EventInstance link | http://hangout.test |
            | Started at         | 10:25:00 UTC        |
        And the time now is "10:26:00 UTC"
        When I am on the show page for event "Mob"
        Then I <assertion> see a link "IT'S TIME TO MOB NOW" to "http://hangout.test"
        Examples:
            | plan        | assertion  |
            | PremiumF2F | should      |
            | PremiumMob | should      |
            | Premium     | should not |
            | Associate   | should not |
            | Free        | should not |


        # ideally what we'd love the Premium/Associate/Free members to see is a note that
        # event is live and a link to upgrade if they'd like to join
        # and perhaps the option to view the video as part of a free trial?

        # maybe a link to start to start the free trial so they could jump in?
