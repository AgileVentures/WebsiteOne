Feature: As a site owner
  So I can make collaboration among registered users easier
  I would like to display a index of users with links to user profiles
  And allow users to search for other users using a variety of criterias

  Background:
    Given I am on the "home" page
    And the following projects exist:
      | title         | description             | status   |
      | hello world   | greetings earthlings    | active   |
      | hello mars    | greetings aliens        | inactive |
      | hello jupiter | greetings jupiter folks | active   |
      | hello mercury | greetings mercury folks | inactive |
      | hello saturn  | greetings saturn folks  | active   |
      | hello sun     | greetings sun folks     | active   |
    And there are no videos
    And the following active users exist
      | first_name | last_name | email                   | projects     | latitude | longitude | updated_at    |
