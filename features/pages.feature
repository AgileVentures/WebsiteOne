Feature: Static pages
  As the site administrator
  So that I can get information across to sites visitors
  I want there to be static pages

  Background:
    Given the following pages exist
      | title         | body                      |
      | About Us      | Agile Ventures            |
      | Sponsors      | AV Sponsors               |
      | Getting Started | Remote Pair Programming |

    And the following page revisions exist
      | title         | revisions  |
      | About Us      | 1          |
    And I am on the "home" page

  Scenario: Render About Us page
    Then I should see link "About Us"
    When I click "About Us"
    Then I should be on the static "About Us" page
    And I should see "About Us"

  # Sponsors and Guides scenarios not really needed. To be removed later.
  Scenario: See Sponsor Banners
    When I am on the "projects" page
    Then I should see sponsor banner for "Makers Academy"
    Then I should see sponsor banner for "AirPair"
    And I should see sponsor banner for "Agile Ventures"
    And I should see link "Become a supporter"

  Scenario: Render Sponsors page
    When I am on the "projects" page
    And I click "Become a supporter"
    Then I should be on the static "Sponsors" page

    When I am on the home page
    And I click "Getting Started"

    And I should see "Remote Pair Programming"

  Scenario: Has a link to edit a page using the Mercury Editor
    Given I am logged in
    And I am on the static "About Us" page
    When I click the very stylish "Edit" button
    Then I should be in the Mercury Editor

  @javascript
  Scenario: Mercury editor shows Save and Cancel buttons
    Given I am logged in
    And I am using the Mercury Editor to edit static "About Us" page
    Then I should see button "Save" in Mercury Editor
    And I should see button "Cancel" in Mercury Editor

    And I fill in the editable field "Body" for "static_page" with "This is my new body text"
    And I click "Save" in Mercury Editor

    Then I should see "You do not have the right privileges to complete action."
    Given I am on the "Projects" page

    Given I am on the static "About Us" page
    Then I should see "Revisions"
    And I should see 4 revisions for the page "About Us"

  Scenario: Page can have children and children should have a correct url
    Given the page "About Us" has a child page with title "SubPage1"
    And I am on the static "SubPage1" page
    Then the current page url should be "about-us/subpage1"

  Scenario: Page should show ancestry details
    Given the page "About Us" has a child page with title "SubPage1"
    And I am on the static "SubPage1" page
    Then I should see ancestry "Agile Ventures >> About Us >> SubPage1"
