Feature: Create projects
  As a member of AgileVentures
  So that I can create a focal point for an AgileVentures project
  I would like to create a new project profile

  Scenario: Show New Project button if user is logged in
    When I have logged in
    And I am on the "projects" page
    Then I should see the very stylish "New Project" button

  Scenario: Do not show New Project button if user is not logged in
    Given I am not logged in
    When I am on the "projects" page
    Then I should not see the very stylish "New Project" button

  Scenario: Creating a new project
    Given I have logged in

    And I should see a form with:
      | Field                |
