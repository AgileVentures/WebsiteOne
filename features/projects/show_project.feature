  As a member of AgileVentures
  So that I can participate in AgileVentures activities
  I would like to view an existing project

  Background:
    Given the following projects exist:
      | title         | description             | pitch       | status   | github_url                                  | pivotaltracker_url                               | commit_count |

      | hello pluto   | greetings pluto folks   |             | inactive |                                             |                                                  | 2000         |

    And The projects have no stories on Pivotal Tracker
    And the following source repositories exist:
      | url                               | project   |
      | https://github.com/HelloSun       | hello sun |
      | https://github.com/HelloSunExtras | hello sun |

    And there are no videos

  Scenario: Project show page renders a list of members
    Given The project "hello world" has 10 members
    And I am on the "Show" page for project "hello world"
    Then I should see "Members (10)"
    But I should see 5 member avatars

  Scenario: Project show page has links to github and Pivotal Tracker
    Given I am on the "Show" page for project "hello world"
    And I should see a link to "hello world" on github
    And I should see a link to "hello world" on Pivotal Tracker

  Scenario: Project show page has links to multiple github repos
    Given I am on the "Show" page for project "hello sun"
    And I should see links to "HelloSun" on github
    And I should see links to "HelloSunExtras" on github

  Scenario: Project show page has hangout button for users that not follow the project
    Given I have logged in
    And I am on the "Show" page for project "hello world"
    When I click "Start Live Hangout" button
    Then I should see "You should join this project before you can start the hangouts"
