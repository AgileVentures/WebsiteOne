Feature: Update github languages field of all projects
  As a website admin
  So that users can see which languages projects use
  I would like to ensure that all languages are added to projects

  Background: projects have been added to database
    Given the following projects exist:
      | title                 | description                              | github_url                                                                                                                                | status   | languages  |

  Scenario: Update language field of all projects with valid github_url
    When I run the rake task for fetching github languages information
    Then I should see projects with the following language updates:
      | title                 | status   | languages    |
      | MetPlus               | active   | Java         |
      | WebsiteTwo            | inactive | CSS          |
      | WebsiteOne            | active   | Shell        |
      | LocalSupport          | active   | CoffeeScript |
      | Rundfunk-Mitbestimmen | active   | JavaScript   |
      | PhoenixOne            | active   | Elixir       |
