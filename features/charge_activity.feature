Feature: Charge Users Money
  As a site admin
  So that users can pay for premium services
  I would like to be able to sign them up for a recurring plan

      | Pricing         | wonga                   |
      | Getting Started | Remote Pair Programming |

  Scenario: There should be a link to the premium page on the navbar
    Given I am on the home page
    Then I should see "PREMIUM" within the navigation bar
