  As site administrator
  In order to simplify interactions between users
  I would like them to be able to set current availability status on their user profile.

  Background:
    Given the following users exist
      | first_name | last_name | email                  | updated_at               |
      | Alice      | Jones     | alicejones@hotmail.com | 2014-09-30 05:09:00 UTC' |
      | Bob        | Butcher   | bobb112@hotmail.com    | 2014-09-30 04:00:00 UTC' |

    And the following statuses have been set
      | status            | user  |
      | Ready to pair     | Alice |
      | Doing code review | Bob   |

    And I should see "Ready to pair"
