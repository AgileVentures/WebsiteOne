Hi Billy,<br />

Thanks so much for joining the websiteone project! - as you might know, it's the Rails code that powers our main site - we coordinate via #websiteone on slack and there's a #websiteone-install channel for help to get set up.<br />

Just reach out if there's anything you need.<br />

Best, Sam
