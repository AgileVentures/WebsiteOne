    <p>Hi Billy,</p>

<p>Thanks so much for joining the WebsiteOne project! - as you might know, it's the Rails code that powers our main site - we coordinate via #websiteone on slack and there's a #websiteone-install channel for help to get set up.</p>
<p>Just reach out if there's anything you need.</p>

<p>Best, Sam</p>
