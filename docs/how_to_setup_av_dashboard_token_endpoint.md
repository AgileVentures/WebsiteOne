## Setting up the secret tokens
You will need to generate a secret token that is 512 bits, or 64 bytes, long.  In python 3, you can do this by:-

```
  import secrets
  secrets.token_hex(64)
```

Then you need to put that token into the WebsiteOne deployed app under the environmental variable AV_DASHBOARD_SECRET_TOKEN.

This same token will also need to be put into the appropriate environmental variable on the AVDashboard app.

## Giving a specific user access to the dashboard

In general, for a user to be given access to the dashboard, they should sign the current Agile Ventures Data Sharing Agreement.  Provided,
they have done this, you can give them access to the dashboard if you know their email as follows in the rails console:-

```
  Users.find_by(email: "somedude@gmail.com").update(can_see_dashboard: true)
```
