AgileVentures provides software project management consulting services to charities and
non-profits around the world.  We coordinate teams of volunteers who want to contribute
to charitable causes and to develop their software development and project management
skills by working in distributed online teams.

The AgileVentures website provides a coordination point for new members hoping to join
existing teams, start new projects and connect with charitable causes.  Existing teams
generally have autonomy in how they run their projects but benefit from guidance, support
and input from senior Agile Ventures members.

Each project is autonomous in terms of choosing technologies and workflow, although Agile
Ventures promotes a short cycle development process with prototypes being delivered to
clients at regular intervals (e.g. weekly) for feedback that allows a team to stay on
track to best support customer needs.

We are deeply committed to open source (all code and documentation shared publicly) and
open development (meetings and pairing recordings shared live where possible), and we
expect all teams to be similarly committed.  We also recommend that each project maintains
its documentation to be as terse and as up to date as possible to facilitate the
onboarding of new members.  The nature of volunteer open source projects means a high
turnover of participating members; ideally it will be as straightforward as possible to
contribute value to a project.

The AgileVentures web site (WSO) has been a learning project for many developers over
the last few years, and huge amounts of work have been put in to get it where it
currently is.  It is a testament to the dedication and commitment of everyone who has
been involved.  However it lacks coherency since it was an experimental learning
project where a number of competing visions have been pursued.

Moving forward WSO will have a more coherent design focus; a new phase for the website
where the emphasis is on doing few things (or perhaps even just one) exceptionally well
rather than being an entry level project where developers implement whichever
experimental features they are interested in. There are plenty of opportunities for
experimentation in the increasing number of new AV projects.  The vision for the AV
website is to support the AV projects and edX MOOC pair programming activities as
effectively as possible in line with the values outlined above.  In order to move forward
coherently the final judgements on the site UX, codebase and workflow will be made by the
senior project manager.   This is because WSO does not have a clear non-technical customer
who can define the single vision like some other AV projects.

The ultimate goal of AgileVentures as a whole is to make the world a better place through
charitable work, learn new skills, and enjoy being able to experiment with different
workflow with friends and colleagues, old and new.  The website is just one element of
many that needs to channel this vision clearly in order to achieve that ultimate goal.
