This is a sample of sponsorship copy from Apache Foundation:

## Why should I sponsor the ASF?
The Apache Software Foundation provides support for the Apache community of open-source software projects. The Apache projects are characterized by a collaborative, consensus based development process, an open and pragmatic software license, and a desire to create high quality software that leads the way in its field. We consider ourselves not simply a group of projects sharing a server, but rather a community of developers and users.

The ASF provides the infrastructure for the projects - the mailing lists, code repositories, bug tracking systems, etc. While all of the administrative effort is currently through unpaid volunteers, we need financial assistance to purchase bandwidth and keep our servers running.

By sponsoring the ASF you show your support for our mission and help sustain a vibrant organization. Sponsorship also shows your support for Open Source and provides you the opportunity to "give back" to the community. Finally, since the ASF is non-profit organization, sponsorship provides attractive tax benefits.

## Where will my sponsorship funds go?
The Apache Software Foundation comprises over 100 top level projects, over 400 active members, over 2000 committers and countless contributors and users. We are responsible for millions of lines of code and the 35+ servers which make up our infrastructure

We also have the normal business operating expenses which go with any organization. These include:

- Bandwidth costs

- Servers and hardware

- Legal and Accounting

- Normal office expenses

- Marketing and PR

- Sub-contractors to "fill in the holes" for administrative and secretarial duties

Your sponsorship will allow the ASF to meet these expenses as well as expand our capability to maintain our leadership in the developer and Open Source communities. Funding will allow us to perform pro-active hardware procurement, enhance our community outreach, sponsor developer hackathons and user groups, and perform non-code related improvements to projects such as better documentation and more comprehensive websites

## The Apache Software Foundation is a non-profit organization
The Apache Software Foundation is a private operating foundation that is registered as a non-profit, charitable organization under Section 501(c)(3) of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code. This means that, for individuals within the U.S., donations to the ASF should be tax-deductible. We are not accountants, so this cannot be trusted as financial advice of any kind, but hopefully this description will be useful to those who advise you in these matters. You may view our ruling letter from the IRS acknowledging our 501(c)3 status.

You may also review the latest financial filings and non-profit exemption application of The Apache Software Foundation in our public records section. You may also find other helpful information through GuideStar (requires free registration for full access).

More information about non-profits and related issues can be found at the Internet Nonprofit Center.

## I'd like to talk to someone about supporting the ASF!
If you would like more information about supporting the ASF, please contact fundraising at apache dot org. Sponsorship donations are handled differently from standard non-directed donations, so if you want your donations to be part of the Sponsorship program (and thus obtain the benefits of the program), you must coordinate the donation with the Public Relations and Fundraising team ( fundraising at apache dot org ).

All information will be kept in strictest confidence.

## How do sponsorship renewals happen?
Your sponsorship will run for one year after the date of receipt of payment. For this period, we shall display your logo on our thanks page.

Two months before the end of your sponsorship, we will contact you (via the same mechanism as was used to arrange the initial sponsorship) requesting renewal. If renewal has not occurred by the renewal date of the sponsorship, the ASF may remove the sponsor's logo from the thanks page.
