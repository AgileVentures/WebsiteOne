Agile Ventures is a non-profit organization dedicated to crowdsourced learning and project development. We run a [project incubator](http://www.agileventures.org/projects) that stimulates and supports development of social innovations, [open source projects and free software][oo-sw]. But first and foremost, we are a [place for learning][about-us] and personal development with [members][members] from across the world with various levels of competence and experience in software development.

We are proudly using Agile methods and Ruby on Rails as the framework to deliver well tested and solid software.

The principal organization behind this project is AgileVentures, a UK based charity.
