    <li>When students are pair programming outside of a closed laboratory or classroom setting, Instructors should provide a systematic mechanism for obtaining studentsâ€™ feedback about their partners and must act upon the feedback when indications are a student is not being&nbsp;<span style="background-color:transparent;line-height:1.6;font-size:10pt">an equal participant.</span></li>
    <li>In each course, students should be evaluated on a balance of individual and collaborative work</li>
    <li>When assigning pairs, instructors should attempt to maximize the chances students will work well together.&nbsp;</li>
    <li>Students should have different partners throughout the semester.&nbsp;</li>
    <li>Students must understand that problems with their partner must be surfaced immediately to give the instructor a chance to correct the situation.&nbsp;</li>

    <li>The programmers in a pair should be working toward a common goal.&nbsp;</li>
