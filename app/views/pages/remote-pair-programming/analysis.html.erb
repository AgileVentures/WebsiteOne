All people who took part had already done homeworks, so it was actually a check and a verification. &nbsp;I had trouble from the lower resolution of my notebook (it was not always easy to read other people' screen), from my difficulty to speak fluently english, and to understand it as well (I'm a bit hard of hearing).&nbsp;Later I was frustrated when during pair programming was required googling. (196) [clarified with student: "<span style="font-size:13px">I thought homeworks had to be done before and people was supposed to take part to pair programming with clear thoughts about how to do things.

It was good to watch others (I learned tricks and little syntax notations that I wasn't familiar with before). Also, I had an idea of how to approach a problem that helped another solve the homework. The reason that I didn't continue was because I didn't feel confident in my programming abilities to be able to 'remote' pair with someone. Perhaps this is something inherent to me, but I feel like I need to 'know' 80% of the homework before I can enter a pair session. (152)</span></span></li>

It was a little awkward getting the hang of the technology for the session. We started as a group of three but eventually had four people show up and split into two groups. The group I was in only got about halfway through the homework before it got too late, but we were productive during this time and I believe everyone viewed the session as a success. I was the driver and I certainly benefited from the input of the other participants, who usually had a solution when I got stuck on some bit of syntax. (149)</span></span></li>

The webcam &amp; mike on my computer are broken, so we just used irc to talk.&nbsp;My pair was someone I knew from previous moocs.  He's a professional programmer but had never paired before. We took turns "driving".  Generally one of us would do a problem, then the other would write tests for it; then we'd swap for the next problem.&nbsp;It was interesting how often we were able to catch one another's syntax &amp; logic errors right away.  If there was syntax neither of us remembered we'd both use google and/or a repl on our local machine until one of us figured it out.&nbsp;There was some confusion when we both tried to take the cursor, but we eventually got used to explicitly asking for control.  He didn't like some of my vim keybindings though :).&nbsp;Overall it was very fun. (84)</span></span></span></span></font></li>

So he had to log out and log back in. Then it was OK.&nbsp;We were all stuck in sort of different places, and it was kinda hard to help someone debug without physical access.

I couldn't find my mic at the time, so I was scrambling to type in order to keep up with the conversation, but my messages often weren't read for some time. Subsequent pair programming sessions with my mic were much easier. It was still useful, and a great learning tool, however I find (and continued to find) that it is a very slow and laborious process. It was much quicker for me to bang out the problem myself after I left my first pair programming session. Later sessions were again more useful, since I had become more experienced I was able to offer more help, and seemed to glean more from watching others.

Some other people showed up in the hangout but did not participate.&nbsp;As for the programming, it didn't feel much like pair programming, as in a driver-observer activity. It was more like a disorganized group programming.&nbsp;The hangout worked surprisingly well for screensharing, and we could comment on each other's code without any problems.&nbsp;However, I couldn't get the hangouts to work from inside the VM, it kept crashing, so I had to connect from my host machine and switch to the VM to code and then back to the host to paste something and so on and so forth, which has been annoying.&nbsp;It was also interesting to meet people from such different backgrounds, like a highschool student from Bangladesh, although his accent was a little bit difficult to understand.

      <li><span style="color:rgb(0,0,0);font-family:arial,sans,sans-serif;font-size:13px;background-color:transparent;line-height:1.6">I think they have their place, however for a course like edX 169 and other MOOCs, I would really like to see an offering of the course materials that lets you go through at your own pace. The course structure really doesn't leave much time for a working professional who has a wife and children to fit it in, yet I don't need to turn to forums at all for assistance, I know very well how to use Google, so I would simply have preferred going through the course with less stringent deadlines for a certificate that doesn't really count in the real world yet.

      <li><span style="color:rgb(0,0,0);font-family:arial,sans,sans-serif;font-size:13px;background-color:transparent;line-height:1.6">Having never used any of the pair programming technologies before it just added and overloaded my ability to accommodate the number and amount of new software tools required during the first 2 weeks of class. Suggest adding a 1- 2 week Pre course setup sessions to get the infrastructure in place so class content can be the focus from day one of the course. The course is over and I still don't have many of the tools working including; Heroku, AWS, putty, SSH, shared folders, Hangouts, rotten potatoes, to name a few. Did buy the ebook, and a Ruby book and did CodeSchool, and ruby Zombies in the hopes that I'll get thru ed169.1 next time. (178)&nbsp;</span></li>
      <li><span style="color:rgb(0,0,0);font-family:arial,sans,sans-serif;font-size:13px;background-color:transparent;line-height:1.6">PP can be very beneficial to coding, but it can present special problems to learning, as well as some solutions. Studying together is not a bad thing, but it's really not exactly pair programming, it's a study session. So while working together is helping, I don't think many here are getting the full experience of PP yet. On the other hand, we are getting what you should expect from a class- exposure if not immersion. (168)</span></li>

There are probably incremental improvements that could be made to the process (there always are) but I can't think of any and it certainly worked as-is. Perhaps a tutorial screencast just to run through how the technology (Google+, etc.) is used and a sample session? (149)</span></li>
      <li><span style="color:rgb(0,0,0);font-family:arial,sans,sans-serif;font-size:13px;background-color:transparent;line-height:1.6">I do not think remote pair programming is convenient for MOOCs. ...&nbsp;I think it would be achievable only between programmers that are in the same level. Especially for edX 169 where much of time one would spend is to find the syntax details or bits and pieces of rails, I do not think it would work for me. ...&nbsp;I do love the concept of pair programming but for a course where you don't just start writing code, but you spent a lot of time searching through Google or studying the ruby and rails docs, I believe it is very hard to accomplish satisfactory pair work.

That is tough on one screen especially with the virtual machine going. I think the problem could stem from the fact that in an in-person pair programming session you are using the same computer/code so you get the code working together but in the course, we each have to submit our own code set so your first priority is not working with the other whether you are navigating or driving, you are worried about getting your code working on your PC as working on one code set and submitting it together is not allowed, which I understand there are very good reasons for that. As for remote pair programming an their connection to edx 169. I found it a very useful element to the homework questions and took a great benefit from them.

At that point, I like to pair up for discussions, optimizations, or even total redesigns of the existing code.  Sometimes, it's hard to think with somebody breathing down your neck, but in the end, that really depends on the personality and knowledge of the person with whom you happen to be pairing.

Until recently (in part 2 of the course we have switched to a private hangout with just 2 of us), it was quite distracting as different people would come and go with different levels of concerns (ranging from clueless to already completed the assignment and just wanting to help). In fact, it was more of a group study (programming) session than actual pair programming. Often productive and interesting, but not actually pair programming (until our recent switch to a private hangout). (126)</span></font></li>

Again to pair it would seem like you'd have to start code from scratch together with just 1 other person.  The hangouts seem to be more of a chat session with live voices.  Unless I'm doing something wrong, it is very hard to make out the text of the screen shares.  Maybe there is a setting to adjust the resolution.

The other people comment on their coding while at the same time tweaking theirs or trying to solve their own problems in another part of the homework.&nbsp;Once everyone is at the same point, it is not clear who is driving and who is observing, since we all have to keep coding or we won't have anything to submit to the grader.&nbsp;The session usually ends when someone who was very active has to leave (usually because it's late and they need to sleep because they have to work the next day).

I can only assume they are attempting to get a passing grade on the AutoGrader without doing any work.&nbsp;Also in pairing sessions with more than 3 programmers, a few observers tend to lurk silently without contributing or offering to drive, I fin this off-putting.&nbsp;Apart from these observations the sessions are very helpful in understanding the content and solving problems together.

Hopefully with the benefit of hindsight I can point them in the right direction, although sometimes I can't remember what was the solution to these common micro-problems and must go from first principles again. Often these students are behind in the course. Often they are looking at the code and trying to figure it out logically when they actually need to check their values. If we get stuck on something, or TA?'s group does, we go and try to get the others to take a look.&nbsp;If I was more familiar with the material or a better student, this scenario might not be so bad.
