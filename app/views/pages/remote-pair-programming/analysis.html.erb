      <li><span style="color:rgb(0,0,0);font-family:arial,sans,sans-serif;font-size:13px;background-color:transparent;line-height:1.6">For difficult coding assignments, yes.  For simple assignments, I think it is faster to code by yourself and more efficient for the project itself. (197)</span></li>
      <li><span style="color:rgb(0,0,0);font-family:arial,sans,sans-serif;font-size:13px;background-color:transparent;line-height:1.6">I would prefer pair programming if done in the extreme way: two people developing a feature together, rather than one person helping the other get out of a rut. I like individual programming in a lazy sense.  Sometimes, for lack of explaining my thoughts, I find it helpful to conjure up something presentable to discuss on my own, which takes some time. At that point, I like to pair up for discussions, optimizations, or even total redesigns of the existing code.  Sometimes, it's hard to think with somebody breathing down your neck, but in the end, that really depends on the personality and knowledge of the person with whom you happen to be pairing.

It can distract my train of thought, but sometimes that's a good thing because your partner may have the answer. I've definitely seen that code could benefit, and students can benefit as well. If both partners are competent in the task at hand, they appreciate the pair programmings system and understand it's strengths and weaknesses, I think it has many benefits such as better code, briefer code, fewer bugs, and better testing.

      <li><span style="color:rgb(0,0,0);font-family:arial,sans,sans-serif;font-size:13px;background-color:transparent;line-height:1.6">In person pair programming is better because you are more engaged and it's easy to share stuff (like pen-and-paper drawings and cheetos) and to switch roles, although modern day tools make this less and less noticeable.&nbsp;Remote pair programming is better for hermits, smokers, nudists, the unshowered, mooc students, and people who choose to work at home in order to properly care for their children.

In fact, I would like to try it, when the time is right.  I don't think trying it over the internet is how I would go about that though.  And for MOOC courses, because it is extremely hard for me to make time for the coursework, I'm not likely to make that more complicated by trying to add pair programming to the mix. (186)</span></li>

We had three people and I had arranged the session to be for just one section of the HW (the second), so we would have what I felt was an achievable goal.  We actually stepped back and went through the first section as well and despite that we blew through both sections in under an hour.  Very productive use of time. (149)</span></span></span></li>

The course structure really doesn't leave much time for a working professional who has a wife and children to fit it in, yet I don't need to turn to forums at all for assistance, I know very well how to use Google, so I would simply have preferred going through the course with less stringent deadlines for a certificate that doesn't really count in the real world yet.

When I had the chance to get something done I grabbed it so I don't think this fit well with the idea of setting up or joining pre-organised sessions. (182)</span></li>
      <li><span style="color:rgb(0,0,0);font-family:arial,sans,sans-serif;font-size:13px;background-color:transparent;line-height:1.6">I would like to see non-assessable (i.e. "non-credit") programming tasks which are related to the assessable homework programming questions and where there is no constraint on communication between students, i.e. no need to worry about breaking the honour code.

Suggest adding a 1- 2 week Pre course setup sessions to get the infrastructure in place so class content can be the focus from day one of the course.  The course is over and I still don't have many of the tools working including;  Heroku, AWS, putty, SSH, shared folders, Hangouts, rotten potatoes, to name a few.  Did buy the ebook, and a Ruby book and did CodeSchool, and ruby Zombies in the hopes that I'll get thru ed169.1 next time. (178)&nbsp;</span></span></li>

Studying together is not a bad thing, but it's really not exactly pair programming, it's a study session. So while working together is helping, I don't think many here are getting the full experience of PP yet. On the other hand, we are getting what you should expect from a class- exposure if not immersion. (168)</span></span></span></li>

Especially for edX 169 where much of time one would spend is to find the syntax details or bits and pieces of rails, I do not think it would work for me. ...&nbsp;I do love the concept of pair programming but for a course where you don't just start writing code, but you spent a lot of time searching through Google or studying the ruby and rails docs, I believe it is very hard to accomplish satisfactory pair work.

It was good to watch others (I learned tricks and little syntax notations that I wasn't familiar with before). Also, I had an idea of how to approach a problem that helped another solve the homework. The reason that I didn't continue was because I didn't feel confident in my programming abilities to be able to 'remote' pair with someone. Perhaps this is something inherent to me, but I feel like I need to 'know' 80% of the homework before I can enter a pair session. (152)</span></span></span></span></span></li>

It was a little awkward getting the hang of the technology for the session.  We started as a group of three but eventually had four people show up and split into two groups.  The group I was in only got about halfway through the homework before it got too late, but we were productive during this time and I believe everyone viewed the session as a success.  I was the driver and I certainly benefited from the input of the other participants, who usually had a solution when I got stuck on some bit of syntax.

        <ul><li><span style="background-color:transparent;line-height:1.6;font-size:10pt">In this scenario, both people would sign on to a common unix host. &nbsp;One person would start a screen &nbsp;and provide the credentials so that the other person(s) could watch the session or interact with the session. &nbsp;This method allows both people to actually make changes during the session when it makes sense to switch control. &nbsp;This method requires that you use an editor on the unix box like vi / vim, which is not always efficient. &nbsp;It worked well for me.</span></li></ul>

          <li><span style="background-color:transparent;font-size:10pt;line-height:1.6">We also used this quite often for the daily 15 minute meetings with the team so that everyone could see the rapid board with the work actively underway. &nbsp;I hesitate to call it scrum, because we didn’t have a scrum master. &nbsp;We had a project manager who led the meeting and then a group of programmers and QA engineers.</span></li></ul>
