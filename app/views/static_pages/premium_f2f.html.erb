      <summary><b>Don't free-tier and premium members get pair programming time with AV Mentors already?</b></summary>
      <p></p>
      <p>Agile Ventures supports ad-hoc pairing all round the world, but we can't guarantee that any free-tier or premium member will necessarily get pairing time with a senior AV mentor. &nbsp;We've had feedback from members that it would be easier to progress&nbsp;if they could rely on having a senior AV mentor available at a particular time and date specified in advance. &nbsp;If we're going to ask senior AV mentors to commit to being available&nbsp;in advance we need to be able to compensate them for their efforts. &nbsp; We've tried operating on a purely ad-hoc basis for several years, and&nbsp;Premium F2F&nbsp;membership&nbsp;is designed to increase the chances of successful learning and good progress on the charitable projects that we support by compensating senior AV members for committing their time.</p>

      <summary><b>Can I use time with my Mentor to talk about Professional Development rather than coding?</b></summary>
      <p></p>
      <p>Face to face support is often&nbsp;all&nbsp;about coding skills, but there is flexibility.&nbsp; Usually the professional development support can be handled
        over Slack and email text chat, with the mentor and premium member
        passing back and forth a planning document.&nbsp; Naturally you could use
        part of the F2F session to talk about the professional development
        support if there are ambiguities or concerns that were left over from
        any text communication.</p>

      <summary><b>Can I choose my Mentor?</b></summary>
      <p></p>
      <p>You can request to work with a
        particular mentor from our <a href="http://www.agileventures.org/mentors">Mentors list</a>. Unfortunately&nbsp;we&nbsp;cannot
        guarantee that any individual mentor will have availability, since this
        will depend on time-zones and other factors.</p>

      <summary><b>Premium&nbsp;F2F&nbsp;is five&nbsp;times the cost of Premium. &nbsp;How come?</b></summary>
      <p></p>
      <p>The main cost of Premium F2F&nbsp;is the time of the Senior&nbsp;AgileVentures Mentor who will work with you for an hour a month&nbsp;helping you hone your pairing, coding and project management skills; as well as discussing your professional development needs. &nbsp;We need to compensate the mentors who put in their time to help you.</p>

      <summary><b>Will my Premium F2F&nbsp;membership&nbsp;auto-renew each month?</b></summary>

      <summary><b>£50/month is a lot of money for me, surely you want Premium F2F&nbsp;to be affordable to everyone, everywhere?</b></summary>
      <p></p>
      <p>Of course we do; however we also want to make our operation sustainable. &nbsp;If you can't afford&nbsp;£50/month please contact&nbsp;<a href="mailto:info@agileventures.org">info@agileventures.org</a>&nbsp;and we will see if we can find sponsorship to cover some or all of the costs of your Premium F2F&nbsp;membership.</p>
