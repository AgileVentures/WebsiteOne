Hi <%= @user.first_name %>,<br />

Thanks so much for joining the <%= @project.title %> project!<% if @project.title == 'websiteone' %> - as you might know, it's the Rails code that powers our main site - we coordinate via #websiteone on slack and there's a #websiteone-install channel for help to get set up.<br />
<% end %>
<% if @project.slack_channel_name.present? %>
  We coordinate via <%= link_to "#{@project.title}", @project.slack_channel %> on slack and are looking forward to working with you.
<% end %>

Just reach out if there's anything you need.<br />

Best, <%= @project_creator.first_name %>
</p>
