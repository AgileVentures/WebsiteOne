Also it is spected because is the heroku best practice recomendation.\n3. Following the ```rails_config``` advice of using with heroku does not work with boolean values. Because it store the values at ```ENV``` variables as strings. And ```features.slack.notifications.enabled``` returns ```\"false\"``` string instead of boolean ```false```, and the string \"false\" becomes true when it is used as a condition.

Improve WSO to update event_instance status.\n - Make work on development / staging / production heroku environments, moving setting to config variables (following heroku and rails_config advices), and use updated rails_config to work with booleans. (done only at my personal heroku wso)\n - Receive broadcasting status from hangout, and update event_instance\n - Respond to ```:live?``` with true if status is not ```finished``` and it was updated within 2 minutes.\n\nAfter this was done, we can start with the subject of this task.\n\n@thomasochman : If you are agree with this approach, I will make all changes to my heroku WSO and we could see how it works before moving to develop.
