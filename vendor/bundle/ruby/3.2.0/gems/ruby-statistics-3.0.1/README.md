# Ruby Statistics

![](https://travis-ci.org/estebanz01/ruby-statistics.svg?branch=master)

A basic ruby gem that implements some statistical methods, functions and concepts to be used in any ruby environment without depending on any mathematical software like `R`, `Matlab`, `Octave` or similar.

Unit test runs under the following ruby versions:
* Ruby 2.7.6.
* Ruby 3.0.4.
* Ruby 3.1.2.

We got the inspiration from the folks at [JStat](https://github.com/jstat/jstat) and some interesting lectures about [Keystroke dynamics](http://www.biometric-solutions.com/keystroke-dynamics.html).

Some logic and algorithms are extractions or adaptations from other authors, which are referenced in the comments.
This software is released under the MIT License.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'ruby-statistics'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install ruby-statistics

## Basic Usage

just require the `statistics` gem in order to load it. If you don't have defined the `Distribution` namespace, the gem will assign an alias, reducing the number of namespaces needed to use a class.

Right now you can load:

* The whole statistics gem. `require 'statistics'`
* A namespace. `require 'statistics/distribution'`
* A class. `require 'statistics/distribution/normal'`

Feel free to use the one that is more convenient to you.

### Hello-World Example
```ruby
require 'statistics'

poisson = Distribution::Poisson.new(l) # Using Distribution alias.
normal = Statistics::Distribution::StandardNormal.new # Using all namespaces.
```

## Documentation
You can find a bit more detailed documentation of all available distributions, tests and functions in the [Documentation Index](https://github.com/estebanz01/ruby-statistics/wiki)

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake spec` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
