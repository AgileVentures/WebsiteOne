* CI stable again - dropped CI support for older versions of Ruby and JRuby.  It is just too painful and there is no evidence that our users need this or that Capybara Screenshot is indeed broken.  It is better to have a reliable build system so that PRs can get merged in reliably and easily.

18 September 2014 - 0.3.22 -> 1.0.0
-----------

Because of the broad test coverage now across RSpec, Cucumber, Spinach, Minitest and TestUnit using [Aruba](https://github.com/cucumber/aruba), I feel that this gem is ready for its first major release.  New features and refactoring can now reliably be done  without the fear of regressions.

The major changes in this 1.0 release are:

* Acceptance test coverage for RSpec, Cucumber, Spinach, Minitest and TestUnit
* Travis CI test coverage across a matrix of old and new versions of the aforementioned testing frameworks, see https://github.com/mattheworiordan/capybara-screenshot/blob/master/.travis.yml
* Support for RSpec 3 using the custom formatters
* Support for sessions using `using_session`, see https://github.com/mattheworiordan/capybara-screenshot/pull/91 for more info
* Support for RSpec DocumentationFormatter
* Considerable refactoring of the test suite

Special thanks goes to [Andrew Brown](https://github.com/dontfidget) who has contributed a huge amount of the code that has helped enable this Gem to have its stable major version release.

22 July 2014 - 0.3.21 -> 0.3.22
-----------

Replaced [colorize](https://rubygems.org/gems/colorize) gem with [colored](https://rubygems.org/gems/colored) due to license issue, see https://github.com/mattheworiordan/capybara-screenshot/issues/93.

22 July 2014 - 0.3.20 -> 0.3.21
-----------

As a result of recent merges and insufficient test coverage, it seems that for test suites other than RSpec the HTML or Image screenshot path was no longer being outputted in the test results.  This has now been fixed, and screenshot output format for RSpec and all other test suites has been standardised.

11 July 2014 - 0.3.19 -> 0.3.20
-----------

* Added reporters to improve screenshot info in RSpec output
* Added support for Webkit options such as width and height

Thanks to https://github.com/multiplegeorges and https://github.com/noniq

2 April 2014 - 0.3.18 -> 0.3.19
-----------

* Added support Spinach, thanks to https://github.com/suchitpuri

2 March 2014 - 0.3.16 -> 0.3.17
-----------

* Added support for RSpec 3 and cleaned up the logging so there is less noise within the test results when a driver does not support a particular format.
* Updated Travis to test against Ruby 2.0 and Ruby 2.1

Thanks to https://github.com/noniq

3 June 2013
-----------

Dropped Ruby 1.8 support for this Gem because of conflicts with Nokogiri requiring a later version of Ruby.  Instead, there is a new branch https://github.com/mattheworiordan/capybara-screenshot/tree/ruby-1.8-support which can be used if requiring backwards compatabiltiy.

18 Apr 2013
-----------

Improved documentation, Ruby 1.8.7 support by not allowing Capybara 2.1 to be used, improved Sinatra support.

-----------

Previos version bump broke Ruby 1.8.7 support, so Travis CI build added to this Gem and Ruby 1.8.7 support along with JRuby support added.

30 Oct 2012 - Significant version bump 0.3
-----------

After some consideration, and continued problems with load order of capybara-screenshot in relation to other required gems, the commits from @adzap in the pull request https://github.com/mattheworiordan/capybara-screenshot/pull/29 have been incorporated.  Moving forwards, for every testing framework you use, you will be required to add an explicit require.


15 Feb 2012
-----------

Merged pull request https://github.com/mattheworiordan/capybara-screenshot/pull/14 to limit when capybara-screenshot is fired for RSpec

30 Jan 2012
-----------

Merged pull request from https://github.com/hlascelles to support Padrino
